# Module:
#   hamqsi_monitor_broker_as
#
# Args:
#   BROKER = name of broker in AppServer
#   QM     = name of queue manager in AppServer
#   DBINST = name of database instance in AppServer
#   MQUSER = userid under which queue manager and broker run
# 
# Description:
#   This is the application monitor script used with HACMP/ES. It 
#   needs to be invoked by a parameter-less wrapper script because
#   HACMP does not allow parameters to be passed to application
#   monitor scripts.
#  
#   This hamqsi_monitor_broker_as script is run as root, and uses 
#   su as needed to monitor the 3 components of the application server.
#  
#   This script is tolerant of a queue manager that is still in
#   startup or a database instance that is still in startup. If 
#   either the queue manager or database is still starting this
#   application monitor script will exit with 0 - which indicates
#   to HACMP that there's nothing wrong. This is to allow for
#   startup time for the queue manager and database instance
#   which may exceed the Stabilisation Interval set for the 
#   Application Monitor in HACMP/ES.
#    
#  
# Exit codes:
#   0  => Broker, DB & QM are all running OK or starting
#   >0 => One or more components are not responding.
#

# Check running as root
if [ `id -u`  -ne 0 ]
