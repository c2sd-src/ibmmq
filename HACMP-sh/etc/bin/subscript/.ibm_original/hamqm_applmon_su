# DESCRIPTION:
#   ${HASCRIPT_DIR}/bin/subscript/hamqm_applmon_su <qmname>
# This is the application monitor script used with HACMP/ES.
#
# This script tests the operation of the QM, by performing a ping.
# HACMP/ES invokes this script via the hamqm_applmon.$qmgr script,
# under the userid that controls the QM. 
# e.g. su - mqm -c ${HASCRIPT_DIR}/bin/subscript/hamqm_applmon_su $qmgr
#
# Exit codes:
# 0  => Either QM is starting or QM is running and responds. 
#       Either is OK.
# >0 => QM is not responding and not starting.
#       Exit code is result of runmqsc command.

QM=$1


# Test the operation of the QM.
echo "ping qmgr" | runmqsc ${QM} > /dev/null 2>&1
pingresult=$?
# pingresult will be 0 on success; non-zero on error (man runmqsc)

if [ $pingresult -eq 0 ]
then # ping succeeded

  echo "hamqm_applmon: Queue Manager ${QM} is responsive"
  result=0

else # ping failed

  # Don't condemn the QM immediately, it may be in startup.
  # The following regexp includes a space and a tab, so use tab-friendly
  # editors.
  srchstr=" $QM[	 ]*$"
  cnt=`ps -ef | grep strmqm | grep "$srchstr" | grep -v grep \
                | awk '{print $2}' | wc -l`
  if [ $cnt -gt 0 ]
  then
    # It appears that QM is still starting up, tolerate
    echo "hamqm_applmon: Queue Manager ${QM} is starting"
    result=0
  else
    # There is no sign of QM start process
    echo "hamqm_applmon: Queue Manager ${QM} is not responsive"
