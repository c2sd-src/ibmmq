# Module:
#   hamqsi_stop_broker_as
#
# Arguments are:
#   broker = name of broker 
#   qm     = name of broker queue manager
#   mquser = user account under which QM and broker run
#   dbinst = name of database instance that holds broker database
#   timeout = max time to allow each phase of stop processing
#
# Description:
#   This script stops the Broker, Queue Manager and Database Instance
#   in that sequence.
#  
#   Broker:
#   The script invokes the hamqsi_stop_broker script to stop the 
#   broker, which checks that the broker is fully stopped.
#  
#   Queue Manager:
#   This script uses the hamqm_stop_su script supplied by WebSphere 
#   MQ SupportPac MC91: High Availability for WebSphere MQ on Unix 
#   platforms, to manage the WebShpere MQ Queue Manager termination.
#   The hamqm_stop_su script ensures that the QM is fully stopped.
#  
#   Database Instance and Database:
#   This script invokes the DB2 HACMP sample hacmp-stop.sh script 
#   to stop the database instance.
#  
#   The hamqsi_stop_broker_as script should be run as root.
