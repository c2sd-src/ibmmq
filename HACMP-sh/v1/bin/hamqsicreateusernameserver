# Create an Application Monitor
# HACMP/ES does not support passing parameters to application monitor
# scripts. So we need to create a unique monitor script for the 
# combination of UNS and QM. The auto-created script is called 
# /MQHA/bin/hamqsi_applmon.UNS and it is this script which is entered
# in the HACMP/ES configuration panels.
