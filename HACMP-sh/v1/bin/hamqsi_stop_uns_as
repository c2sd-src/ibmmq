# Module:
#   hamqsi_stop_uns_as
#
# Arguments are:
#   qm      = name of uns queue manager
#   mquser  = user account under which QM and broker run
#   timeout = time to allow (seconds) for stop to complete
#
# Description:
#   This script stops the UNS and Queue Manager, in that sequence.
#  
#   UserNameServer:
#   The script invokes the hamqsi_stop_uns script to stop the 
#   UserNameServer, which checks that the UserNameServer is fully 
#   stopped.
#  
#   Queue Manager:
#   This script uses the hamqm_stop_su script supplied by WebSphere 
#   MQ SupportPac MC91: High Availability for WebSphere MQ on Unix 
#   platforms, to manage the WebShpere MQ Queue Manager termination.
#   The hamqm_stop_su script ensures that the QM is fully stopped.
#  
#   The hamqsi_stop_uns_as script should be run as root.
#
