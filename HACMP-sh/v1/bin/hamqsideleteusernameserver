# Module: hamqsideleteusernameserver
#
# Args:
#   mquser  = userid under which UNS service runs
#
# Description:
#   This script deletes the UNS. It has to be run on the 
#   node on which the UNS is currently hosted. The script
#   detects whether the UNS is currently present or whether 
#   this node is acting only as a standby. If the UNS is 
#   present it is deleted. If it is not present an error 
#   message is generated.
#
#   The UNS must be removed from HACMP control and stopped
#   before calling this script.
#
#   Runs as root and uses su when deleting UNS
#
#

# Check running as root
