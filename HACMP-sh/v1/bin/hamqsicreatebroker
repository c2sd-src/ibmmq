# Args:
#   Arguments are the same as for mqsicreatebroker
#
# Description:
#   This script creates an MQSI broker so that it can run 
#   in an HA cluster.
#
#   A broker relies on a database, which is run within 
#   a database instance. This script assumes that the 
#   database instance name is the same as the userid
#   under which the instance is run.
#
#   Runs as root and uses su when creating broker
# 
#

# is entered in the HACMP/ES configuration panels.
