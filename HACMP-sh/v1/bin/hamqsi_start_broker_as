#
# Description:
#   Starting an MQSI Broker requires the following services:
#   (1) The MQSeries Queue Manager which supports the Broker  
#   (2) The MQSI Broker service 
#   This script provides a single source to initiate the required 
#   services in sequence. 
#  
#   Queue Manager:
#   This script uses the strmqm script supplied by MQSeries V7
#  
#   Broker:
#   This script then invokes the hamqsi_start_broker script which 
#   checks that the broker is fully stopped and then starts it.
#
#   The hamqsi_start_broker_as script should be run as root.



# Check running as root
#if [ `id -u`  -ne 0 ]
#then
#  echo "Must be running as root"
#  exit 1
