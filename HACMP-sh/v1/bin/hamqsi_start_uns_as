# Module:
#   hamqsi_start_uns_as
#
# Args:
#   qm = name of broker queue manager
#   mquser = user account under which QM and Broker are run
#
# Description:
#   Starting an MQSI UNS requires the following services:
#   (1) The MQSeries Queue Manager which supports the UNS
#   (3) The MQSI UNS service (bipservice)
#   This script provides a single source to initiate the required 
#   services in sequence. 
#  
#   Queue Manager:
#   This script uses the hamqm_start_su script supplied by MQSeries
#   SupportPac MC63: MQSeries for AIX - Implementing with HACMP, 
#   to start the MQSeries Queue Manager. The hamqm_start_su script 
#   ensures that the QM is fully stopped before starting it.
#  
#   UserNameServer:
#   This script then invokes the hamqsi_start_uns script which 
#   checks that the UNS is fully stopped and then starts it.
#
#   The hamqsi_start_uns_as script should be run as root.
#


# Check running as root
