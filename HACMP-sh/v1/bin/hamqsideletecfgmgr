# Module: hamqsideletecfgmgr
#
# Args:
#   configmgr  = name of configmgr to delete
#   mquser  = userid under which configmgr service runs
#
# Description:
#   This script deletes a configmgr. It has to be run on the 
#   node on which the configmgr is currently hosted. The script
#   detects whether the configmgr is currently present or whether 
#   this node is acting only as a standby. If the configmgr is 
#   present it is deleted. If it is not present an error 
#   message is generated.
#
#   The configmgr must be removed from HACMP control and stopped
#   before calling this script.
#
#   Runs as root and uses su when deleting configmgr
#
#

# Check running as root
