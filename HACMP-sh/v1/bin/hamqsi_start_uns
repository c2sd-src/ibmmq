# Description:
#   This script attempts to start the UserNameServer
#
#   It should be run as the userid under which the UNS service 
#   runs.
#


# Ensure that the UNS is not already running. In this test
# we look for any UNS-related processes, which may have
# been left around after a previous failure. Any that remain
# must now be terminated. This is a brutal means of mopping 
# up UNS processes.
# We stop the processes in the following order:
#   bipservice       - first so it cannot issue restarts
#   bipuns           - last 
#
