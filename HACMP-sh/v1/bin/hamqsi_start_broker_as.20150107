# Module:
#   hamqsi_start_broker_as
#
# Args:
#   broker = broker name
#   qm     = name of broker queue manager
#   mquser = user account under which QM and Broker are run
#   dbinst = name of database instance which contains broker db
#   dbname = name of broker db
#
# Description:
#   Starting an MQSI Broker requires the following services:
#   (1) The MQSeries Queue Manager which supports the Broker  
#   (2) The DataBase used for the Broker configuration data
#   (3) The MQSI Broker service 
#   This script provides a single source to initiate the required 
#   services in sequence. 
#  
#   Queue Manager:
#   This script uses the hamqm_start_su script supplied by MQSeries
#   SupportPac MC63: MQSeries for AIX - Implementing with HACMP, 
#   to start the MQSeries Queue Manager. The hamqm_start_su script 
#   ensures that the QM is fully stopped before starting it.
#  
#   Database Instance and Database:
#   This script ensures the database instance is not already running,
#   and then invokes the DB2 HACMP sample hacmp-s1.sh script to start
#   the database instance and restart the database. Note that the 
#   hacmp-s1.sh script assumes that the database has autorestart 
#   disabled. 
#  
#   Broker:
#   This script then invokes the hamqsi_start_broker script which 
#   checks that the broker is fully stopped and then starts it.
#
#   The hamqsi_start_broker_as script should be run as root.



# Check running as root
#if [ `id -u`  -ne 0 ]
#then
#  echo "Must be running as root"
#  exit 1
