# DESCRIPTION:
#   /MQHA/bin/hamqm_running <qmname>
# This script is used by other hamqm scripts to return a
# boolean (1 or 0) indicating whether the named QM is running.
QM=$1

# This function will test whether the QM is running and
# returns 1 if it is, or 0 if it is not.

# Find the status file....
QMDIR=`/MQHA/bin/hamqm_qm_directory ${QM}`

# Parse the status file to find the CurrentStatus for 
# the Queue Manager. The following awk script selects only
# QueueManagerStatus stanzas and ignore others, such as
# CommandServerStatus.

# The regular expression in the next line contains a tab character
# Edit only with tab-friendly editors.
RESULT=`/usr/bin/cat ${QMDIR}/qmstatus.ini | \
  grep -v "^[ 	]*#" | awk -F=  \
  ' BEGIN {
      expecting_status="no";
      status="not_found";
    }
